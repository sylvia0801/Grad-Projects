# Grad-Projects
This repository contains projects that are completed during my graduate times (2019-present) at Boston University.

## Classes Taken with Projects
CS581 Computational Fabrication: Mask Maker
```
This project is a mask designer that by taking in a front-face picture of the user, 
a mask model that is specifically designed for the user gets outputted in STL file 
to 3D printing.
```


CS591 Object Oriented Design and Development in Java: Easy Grader
```
This project is a user-friendly, robust grading system that allows a particular 
professor to enter information of students taking her classes and enter the grading
criteria of each classes.
```

CS591 Mobile App Development: Woohoo
```
This project is a second-hand buy-and-sell platform designed specifically for students on campus that allows users to act as roles of sellers and buyers, where the seller can post items they want to sell and buyers can buy items they are interested in with easy-handed steps.
```

CS591 Deep Learning: DpicNet
```
This project is a contributed try made to Intel Scene Classification Challenge. It is a convolutional neural network structure that trains image data containing scenes of 6 categories: buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street and predicts given image using the trained model.
