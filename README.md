# Grad-Projects
This repository contains projects that are completed during my graduate times (2019-present) at Boston University.

## Classes Taken with Projects
CS581 Computational Fabrication: Mask Maker
```
• Programmed an application that takes in a front-face picture of the user and outputs
a mask model that is specifically designed for the user based on the user’s facial 
landmarks and the dimension reference QR code
• The app is mainly built in Python by combining OpenCV and Blender API and the mask
model generated is specifically a mask model in STL file to 3D printing
```


CS591 Object Oriented Design and Development in Java: Easy Grader
```
• Built a user-friendly, robust grading system that allows a particular professor 
to enter information of students taking her classes and enter the grading criterias
of calculating the final grade of homework, exams, attendance, etc. while at the 
same time keeps track of student’s record in the database
• The system is mainly designed in Java and replied on SQLite database based on the
goal of object-oriented programming
