# Grad-Projects
This repository contains projects that are completed during my graduate times (2019-present) at Boston University.

## Classes Taken with Projects
CS581 Computational Fabrication: Mask Maker
```
• Program an application that takes in a front-face picture of the user, asks the user to
select a mask model either already built-in in the system or upload a picture of the
mask by themselves, outputs a mask model that is specifically designed for the user
• The app is mainly built in Python by combining OpenCV and Blender API and the
mask model generated is specifically a mask model in STL file to 3D printing
```


CS591 Object Oriented Design and Development in Java: Easy Grader
```
• Build a grading system that allows a particular professor to enter student’s name, 
student ID number and email as must-have columns, and enter percentage of calculating 
the final grade of homework, exams, attendance, etc. and keep track of student’s record
in the database
• The system is mainly designed in Java and the database it is replied on is still to be
determined at the current stage
