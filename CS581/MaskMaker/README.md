## Project Description
```
• Programmed an application that takes in a front-face picture of the user 
and outputs a mask model that is specifically designed for the user based 
on the user’s facial landmarks and the dimension reference QR code
• The app is mainly built in Python by combining OpenCV and Blender API and
the mask model generated is specifically a mask model in STL file to 3D printing
